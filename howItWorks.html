    <h1 class="display-4 text-center">How Does It Work?</h1>

    <p>The way the online world works right now is:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You do stuff online like shopping, looking up stuff, paying bills, watching videos, etc</li>
        <li>All your data is collected to build a profile of you, like how old you are, male/female,
            interests, etc., by companies. This is done in a way where the companies doing it don't want you
            to be aware of what they are doing (it's a bit slimy) </li>
        <li>Your data is sold to businesses trying to advertise to you by these companies that collect your
            data</li>
        <li>You see adds that businesses pay for when you go online</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Google, Facebook, etc make hundreds of billions of dollars doing this!</p>
    <p>
        So, there are a few problems with this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You are getting ripped off</li>
        <li>This is a slimy practice only done because it makes so much money</li>
        <li>What if your data gets sold to a bad actor? Most people in the US, you can fairly quickly find
            their address, email address and emails, cell number and their current location (if they have
            their cell on them). Whether its your ex, some serial killer and just some government department,
            why allow them to have this info on you if you can fairly easily block it?</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- <div class="words"> -->

        <p>
            How the Internet should work regarding your data:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You go online, do your thing</li>
            <li>As companies want your data, they try to get your data</li>
            <li>You have easy-to-use software blocking their evil software</li>
            <li>Your data is saved by the same software, encrypted with your password so no one can read it, not
                even us</li>
            <li>If you like, you can sell your data to businesses and receive most of the money businesses pay to
                advertise to you
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="question text-center mt-5">Wait, I Get Paid to Do What I'm Already Doing?!</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, right now you are giving your data away. And soon, you will be able to sell your data you create online
            everyday and receive monthly income. The amount of income will vary depending on how many businesses use
            this platform and how much they spend on advertising but it has the potential to be $50 per month based on
            how much Google is making off of your data.</p>

        <p class="mb-5">

        <h2 class="question text-center mt-5">So How Do I Get this Software So I Can Start Earning?</h2>
        <p>
            First we will be starting with a Chrome extension that you would download once we email you a link.
            Then you would just use the Chrome browser when ever you are online, on whatever device you are using.</p>

        <p>
            In order to get paid, we will need your contact data, bank account
            data (to direct deposit your money), etc. Once you opt in to get paid and start using the software,
            we will send you a link where you can fill out all this info.
        </p>

        <p>Right now we are still building and prototyping our software so it is not ready yet. And we still
            need to get businesses to sign up to this in order to pay you. But you can sign up
            <a href="index.html#signUpForm">here</a> on our wait list and we will let you know when we are ready for
            you!
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2 class="question text-center mt-4">So How Does Your Company Make Money?</h2>
        <p>
            We take all these people that have signed up or are using the software and go to businesses and get
            them to pay for advertising directly to consumer. Most of the money they pay goes to you.</p>
        <p>Say you are a business owner and you are wondering
            if you should put a coffee shop in a certain place in the city. You need to know if there will be
            plenty of people that buy coffee in that part of town. You could then buy the info of who likes
            coffee that is near your planned coffee shop as well as reach out via email, etc to invite them to
            your coffee store. Most of the money that is paid for this info goes to the users, a percent goes to
            this business.
