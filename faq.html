    <h1 class="display-4 text-center mt-3 mb-5">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <p><b>This sounds a little scammy. How are you able to pay me for browsing the Internet?</b></p>
    <p> We get it, it sounds odd. There are always businesses that need to reach consumers and they pay to reach
        them. Right now, you have a few big players online that you usually need to pay to reach consumers. We are
        just providing a way for businesses to more directly and tranparently reach consumers to sell their
        products. If you think of Google and Facebook as bouncers to a great club that everyone wants to get into
        and charging huge entry fees, we found the side door and we're offering a much better rate </p>

    <p><b>So once I use your software, anyone can buy my search history?</b></p>
    <p>No, your search history will get categorized and businesses will buy a lists of everyone who searches for sports
        stuff online or searches for raising children stuff, etc. They only want to know what you are interested in to
        promote to you their prodcuts</p>

    <p><b>Am I going to get more spam when I use your app?</b></p>
    <p>Possibly but unlikely. It should be the same as without our software but the adds you receive should be more
        tailored to you</p>

    <p><b>Will your software be easy to use?</b></p>
    <p>Yes, once you download the Chrome extension, everything will be pretty normal to you. There is one major
        difference when you are using our software - you wont have a web history saved on the browser(it will be saved
        in a file on the desktop) and you will be logged out of websites pretty quickly. The reason for this is by
        blocking your web history and getting rid of cookies(which will log you out of websites), you leave much less
        data about you available online. If businesses want this data, instead of taking it for free, now they will need
        to buy it</p>

    <p><b>How do I know your software is safe?</b></p>
    <p>Good question. For competetive reasons, we can't show our code so you will have take that chance. And honestly,
        you are probably giving away your data to many sites and none of them are likely paying you. We will pay you for
        your data</p>

    <p><b>Is there a guarantee of getting paid a certain amount?</b></p>
    <p>No, it depends businesses paying for your data. We pay you when we get paid. Think of us as selling your data and
        taking a percent for our commision. We may introduce a bonus offer for your first month after we raise
        funding</p>

    <p><b>Does your software only work with search history? What about other stuff?</b></p>
    <p>Next we will be working on purchase history, adding that feature to the software. There are alot more areas to
        expand into after that</p>

    <p><b>What if I don't have a bank account?</b></p>
    <p>You can still use the software just don't choose the get-paid option. We will be working on paying in crypto in
        the future so that everyone can get paid</p>

    <p><b>What about outside the US?</b></p>
    <p>Sorry but this is for only inside the US right now</p>

    <p><b>What if I don't care about selling my data - I just want online privacy?</b></p>
    <p>You can just not opt into the get-paid option and we wont have any info on you except your first name and email
        and the software will block many of the website tracking methods. You should also look into <a
            href="https://duckduckgo.com">Duckduckgo</a> to replace Google and <a href="https://proton.me">Proton
            Mail</a> to replace your normal email as well as using crypto and cash instead of credit cards for more
        privacy</p>
